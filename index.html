    <h2> What is this plane? </h2> 
    <p> Concorde was a <strong>supersonic airliner</strong>, developed by a consorcium of <i> BAC </i>(England) and <i>Aerospaciále </i> (France) in the 1960s. Being one of the <a href="https://tu-144-website.bernardofonsec2.repl.co/" target="_blanck">2 only existing aircrafts of this class </a>, Concorde was operated by only 2 operators: <b>Air France</b> and <b>British Airways.</b> It had a astonishing speed of about <b> Mach 2.2 (2.2 times the speed of sound)</b> and carried between <b> 80 and 120 passangers. </b> </p>

    <h2> Maximum Inovation </h2>
    <p> At the time of it's creation, Concorde presented an incredible number of inovations, being the main ones: </p>

    <div class="fundo-azul-transparencia">
    <ol>
      <li> Dropable nose, to reduce drag at supersonic speeds and allow good visibily on take-off and landing moments; </li>
      <li>  A special ogival delta wing, to allow flights at all speeds; </li>
      <li> An inovative system of electrical control  (antecessor of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk-VSv-DaE0" target="_blanck">Fly-by-Wire </a>);</li>
      <li> Engines that allowed supersonic flight during hours, <strong> without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXN1ad3AgNE&t=22s" target="_blanck"> afterburners </a> </strong> </li> 
      <li> Special airframe, made of a lightweight and heat resistent aluminium steel </li>

      <h2> The story </h2> 
      <section>
      <p> This story begins in the 1950's. At the time, the world was going under a revolution. It was the transition from old piston propeller engines to more advanced jet and turboprop engines. And, although this by itself was revolutionary, many were expecting amuch bigger jump: the beginning of supersonic comercial flights. There were already military supersonic planes; mostly fighters and bombers. However, they presented a big amount of problems: </p>
      <div class="fundo-azul-transparencia">
      <ul>
        <li> Unreliability </li>
        <li> Big inefficiency </li>
        <li> Terrible low speed performance </li>
        <li> Large infrastructure requirements </li>
      </ul> 
      </div>
      <p> So, at the time, creating a reliable supersonic airliner would be impossible. </p>

      </div> 
      <p> But as time went on, the industry started to develop new solutions, being the main one the creation of <b> delta wing concepts </b>, a special wing that would increase reliability, performance and reduce infrastructure requirements. The future creation of many variants of the delta concept would improve even more these parameters. </p>

      <img src="delta wings final.png" alt="Delta wing variants" width="400">
      <p> With these evolutions, it was now possible to create a supersonic airliner. </p> 
      <p> From this point, a competition started to build this machine: the british planned to build a long-range 150 passenger's supersonic airliner with 6 engines, while the french planned to do a regional 70 passanger's supersonic airliner, with 4 engines. However, as time went on, both countries realised that their individual resources wouldn't be enough, and that they were building pretty much the same thing. From this realisation came one of the most legendary partnerships in history: the BAC/Sud Aviation (which became aerospaciále in the aftermah) in 1962. </p>
